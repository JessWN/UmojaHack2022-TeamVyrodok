# UmojaHack Hackathon 2022

The team members for the Hackathon are:

- Teddy Waweru
- Linda Kelida
- Eric Mbuthia
- Jessica Njuguna

In preparation for the Hackathon, the team participated in the *Insurance Policy Lapse Prediction*. The team built a model that could predict if an insurance policy will lapse or not. Insurance companies that used this model could use it to forecast their customer churn. Churn provides insight on the changes in the revenue. The model used is *One Class SVM*.  The code for this is in the main.ipynb notebook.

For the Hackathon, we took the *Faulty Air Quality Sensor Challenge*. The model built is used to classify is a sensor is faulty or not. The base model used was Decision Tree Classifier and the best model was the *XGBoost Classifier*. The code for this challenge is in the challenge.ipynb notebook.
